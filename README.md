# ðŸ¤– AI Virtual Mouse

The AI Virtual Mouse is a gesture-controlled software application that replaces the traditional mouse with hand gestures using computer vision and artificial intelligence. This project uses a standard webcam to detect hand movements and simulate cursor movements, clicks, and other actions â€” enabling a touch-free and intuitive user experience.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Move the mouse cursor using index finger gestures
- Perform left and right clicks with pinch gestures
- Drag-and-drop using sustained pinch
- Control volume or brightness (custom feature extension)
- Simple GUI to start/stop the tracking system
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
